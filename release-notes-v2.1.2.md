# Stinsen v2.1.2 - Architecture Refactoring & View Factory Extraction

## 🏗️ Major Architecture Refactoring

### ✨ New Features
- **NavigationViewFactory Protocol**: Extracted view creation logic from PresentationHelper
- **DefaultNavigationViewFactory**: Standard implementation of the factory pattern
- **NavigationViewFactoryRegistry**: Thread-safe registry for factory management
- **Improved File Organization**: Logical directory structure for better maintainability

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Navigation logic and view creation are now separate
- **Enhanced Testability**: Factory pattern enables easy mocking for unit tests
- **Cleaner Architecture**: PresentationHelper focuses purely on navigation state management
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintained zero overhead through efficient delegation

```

### 🎯 Key Benefits
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation between navigation and presentation concerns
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: Custom view creation strategies through factory pattern
- **Improved Testing**: Easy mocking and testing of view creation logic
- **Cleaner Code**: Focused responsibilities for each component
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing APIs

### 📱 Usage Examples
```swift
// Using default factory (automatic)
let helper = PresentationHelper(coordinator: coordinator)

// Using custom factory for testing
let mockFactory = MockNavigationViewFactory()
let helper = PresentationHelper(coordinator: coordinator, viewFactory: mockFactory)

// Registering global custom factory
NavigationViewFactoryRegistry.shared.register(customFactory)
```

### 🧪 Testing Improvements
- Factory pattern enables comprehensive view creation testing
- Separated navigation logic testing from view testing
- Improved unit test isolation and reliability

### 🔗 Key Changes
- **NavigationViewFactory.swift** - New factory protocol and implementation
- **PresentationHelper.swift** - Refactored to use factory delegation
- **File Reorganization** - Moved files to logical directory structure
- **API Compatibility** - All existing APIs remain unchanged

### 📋 Breaking Changes
None - this release maintains full backward compatibility while improving internal architecture.

### 🚀 Migration Guide
No migration required - all existing code continues to work without changes. The refactoring is internal and preserves all public APIs.

This release significantly improves the architecture while maintaining backward compatibility, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible for future development.
